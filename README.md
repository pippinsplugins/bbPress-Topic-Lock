bbPress Topic Lock
==================

Warns moderators if another moderator is currently viewing the same topic.

Based heavily off of the WordPress post locking system. Uses the WP heartbeat API to set the topic lock status.

If a topic is locked (because another moderator is already viewing it), a warning dialog will be displayed. Moderators and choose to ignore the lock if they wish.
